   <p> Should you have an Abortion? Many people have different opinions about abortion. Some have said " You shouldn't your kill a life" Others have said and I quote 'My body, My choice' This opinion mostly comes from women who want to abort but can't. Women are treated horribly about choosing to abort and feel like they dont have a choice but to keep it. 
     Women don't want to keep a baby if it's from a random stranger. This is why women are afraid to walk around the city at night. These things happen becasue women are being treated as objects or someone to replace and throw away once their done. -In the picture down below you can kinda see if you were to get an abortion at (10 weeks) being compared to the size of a pencil- </p> <img src="https://149824698.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/gallery/abortion-pictures/thumbs/thumbs_10_weeks-04_medium.jpg">

    <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 3 below. --> <p> Should you have an abortion? Many people have different perspective about abortion and why they shoudl have it. Lots of people, Including the government tell woman 'If you have an abortion your killing your own baby'
    As a women my opinion matters more than than anyone else's because they aren't having the baby, I am. A women is. Even though times are changing and men will soon be able to have kids too,but it's still women's opinions that need to be hear. Our bodies have to adapt to the baby growing and we have to go through this for nine months. It puts us through a lot of stress, and insecurity and we have to put up with this and on top of this be a wife or girlfriend and have respondsiblities too.</p>
