   <p> Should you have an Abortion? Many people have different opinions about abortion. Some have said " You shouldn't your kill a life" Others have said and I quote 'My body, My choice' This opinion mostly comes from women who want to abort but can't. Women are treated horribly about choosing to abort and feel like they dont have a choice but to keep it. 
     Women don't want to keep a baby if it's from a random stranger. This is why women are afraid to walk around the city at night. These things happen becasue women are being treated as objects or someone to replace and throw away once their done. -In the picture down below you can kinda see if you were to get an abortion at (10 weeks) being compared to the size of a pencil- </p> <img src="https://149824698.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/gallery/abortion-pictures/thumbs/thumbs_10_weeks-04_medium.jpg"><!-- Add text, images, and links for section 2 below. -->
